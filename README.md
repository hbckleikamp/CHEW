# CHEW





To improve accessibility CHEW is constructed as a collection of modular routines.
CHEW can be executed as a single script, or if only parts of the CHEW pipeline should be executed, subroutines can be executed instead.
For example, if the user only wishes to convert raw to mzML, then the subroutine raw2mzML can be executed.


To further improve accesibility, each subroutine can be executed in a variety of ways.
A subroutine can be run directly from a python interpreter (Such as Spyder), or a subroutine can be callied from a command line interface.

Default arguments are listed within the subroutine itself.
These can be edited manually, or be supplied from a tabular parameter file.
Each of default arguments can also be supplied from the command line, using the same syntax.


CHEW consists of 3 main routines, which are subdivided into several subroutines.
